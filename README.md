<h1> Prog_funds assignment </h1>
The interpreter reads an assembly program from a ".asm" file (text file). It must execute the instructions sequentially on the virtual machine updating the PC (program counter) after each instruction. At the end of execution, it will produce a dump of all registers and memory to the screen in addition to the output window (results of the I/O operations).
Included functions:
  - Move operations
  - Mathematical operations
  - Rotation and shifting operations
  - Basic I/O operations
  - Loading data from memory
  - Storing data to memory
